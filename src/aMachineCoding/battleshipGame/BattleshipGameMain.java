/*
    Battleship Game

    Design a class diagram for a software-based version of the traditional Battleship game.
    The design should clearly capture the core components, rules, and interactions of the game.

    Game Setup:
    - The game is played using two grids per player:
        one for placing their ships and another for tracking shots against the opponent.
    - Each player secretly positions their ships on their own grid.
        Ships may only be placed horizontally or vertically â€” diagonal placements are not allowed.
    - The standard fleet consists of different types of ships
        (e.g., Aircraft Carrier, Battleship, Submarine, Destroyer, Patrol Boat),
        with each type occupying a specific number of consecutive cells.

    Gameplay:
    - Players alternate turns, attempting to target and hit their opponent's ships.
    - After each shot, the opponent responds with either "hit" or "miss."
    - When all cells of a specific ship are hit, that ship is considered sunk.
        The opponent must announce the event (e.g., "You sunk my battleship!").

    Winning the Game:
    - A player wins when all of their opponent's ships are completely sunk.
    - The first player to sink the entire enemy fleet is declared the winner.
